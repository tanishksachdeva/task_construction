Collect is a data collection application. It is our workhorse. Over 150 organisations from all over the world trust Collect for their data collection use cases. It is deployable in the remotest of places, ofcourse, works without internet and will run swiftly on the cheapest of Android devices. One of our partners recently used Collect to track progress of their Sanitation Infrastructure project. The survey was conducted across the state involving multiple vendors who were responsible for data collection. 
How was the data collected:
The construction of a single project was split in 5 phases, each one corresponding to the level the construction has reached. These phases are Pit (1) - Foundation (2) - Structure (3) - Roof (4) and Fittings (5). The auditor is responsible to track this construction by collecting accurate information as soon as the construction for a stage is completed. 

Data points which are filled by the auditor at every stage are as follows (Those marked with * are compulsory): 

Select Current Stage of the Construction *
Name of Gram Panchayat/Mohalla *
Name of Village/Locality *
Name of Sub-District *
Beneficiary's Name *
Age of the Beneficiary *
Beneficiary's Gender *
Beneficiary's Address as per ID Proof *
LOCATION (Latitude/Longitude information with accuracy)* [A user cannot enter this information - auto generated by the device]
Mobile number of Beneficiary *
BENEFICIARY ID Details
Construction Image*
Data verification
Since the data was collected by multiple vendors, and each of them were responsible to survey multiple sites, a data verification process is required which makes it easy to identify false information collected during the surveys and take action accordingly. Let's consider some sample use cases where the auditor can enter false information: 

Suppose the construction till Stage 4 was completed at Site A, and was only completed till Stage 2 at Site B. Now the vendor, who obviously wants to get the work done quickly and go home happy with his payments, can take the image of the Stage 4 construction site in the response for Stage 2 construction site and mark it as complete. It will be a difficult process for our partners to verify this information unless they visit the field and check for themselves which takes a lot of time. 
Problem to solve
Verification of data is important for our partners since it directly affects the finances and they don't want to pay if the construction is not actually completed. As a Data Analyst at SocialCops, your task here is to design a data verification process and share a report with client so they can take an action accordingly.
